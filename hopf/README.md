# Fractile

![fractile](http://philogb.github.io/assets/random/2.jpg)

Fractile is a space-filling visualization based on a random space filling tiling of the plane technique that serves as a slideshow for Tweets and Vines.

 * Live demo here: [Fractile](http://philogb.github.io/page/fractile)
 * Youtube video here: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj_ncLwsJmI)
 * Blog post here: [Blog post](http://philogb.github.io/space-filling-vines/)

## Usage

Clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/philogb/remix.git`

Go to the fractile project

`cd remix/fractile`

Install all node modules (if you don't have npm install npm first)

`npm install`

Run with:

`grunt serve`


## Options

There are multiple layouts you can choose from, customize color, images,
videos, logos displayed. On each layout there are about 100,000
primitives being displayed. These are taken from a config.json file.
Here's an example of an entry showing Vines:

      {
        "title": "Art Vines",
        "layout": "rotated_squares1",
        "shape": "rotated_square",
        "icon": "vine_white",
        "icon_background": [
          [8, 191, 143]
        ],
        "vines": {
          "displayed": 3,
          "vine_ids": [
            "a1.mp4",
            "a2.mp4",
            "a3.mp4"
          ]
        }
      }

 * `title` displays a title before laying out the elements.
 * `layout` is the layout to choose from. There are
   `circles{1,2,3,4,5}`, `rectangles{1,2,3,4,5}` and `rotated_squares1`.
 * `shape`, depends on the layout. The options are `circle`, `rectangle`
   and `rotated_rectangle` respectively.
 * `icon`, loaded from `images/*` the icon is a link to an image to be
   used on top of each shape. Options are `vine_white`, `vine_green`,
`twitter_blue` and `twitter_white`.
 * `icon_background`, an array of arrays of colors set in RGB format.
 * `vines` a complex object containing two main properties. `displayed`
   sets the number of vines/tweets to be shown in total for that layout.
`vine_ids` are paths for files stored in `images/*`.

Here's an example for showing Tweets:

    {
      "title": "#Sunset",
      "layout": "circles4",
      "shape": "circle",
      "icon": "twitter_white",
      "icon_background": [
        [29, 172, 238]
      ],
      "tweets": {
        "displayed": 3,
        "tweet_ids": [
          "557347023876153344",
          "557342384779182080",
          "557332716228599808"
        ]
      }
    }

Main difference is that instead of using `vines` we use `tweets` and
provide a `tweetIds` array.

## Support

This works on Chrome and Firefox 35+. Safari doesn't seem to support
this (maybe due to an issue with the video formats). Mobile Safari doesn't either (maybe due to an issue with instanced
arrays).
